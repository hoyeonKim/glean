<h1>NAME</h1> glean &#45; search engine for local text content</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> glean is a fast, lightweight search engine for large collections of text files. Rather than indexing every location where each token occurs (potentially 40-50+% the size of the indexed content), its index maps tokens to files, but falls back on <b>grep</b> at the file level. Consequently, its index is proportionately much smaller (typically only 2-3%), and can be quickly (re-)built.<p>
<b>gln_index(1)</b> is used to build the index, and <b>gln(1)</b> is used for searching. gln_index runs gln_filter(1) to determine whether files should be indexed or ignored, and gln_tokens(1) to get the set of tokens present in indexed files.<p>
The indexed files are not required to have any specific structure; they are just treated as lists of whitespace-separated words. It's designed to be used as a first-pass index for <i>everything,</i> to maximize serendipitous discovery. The results from glean are like those from <b>grep -r foo /</b> , only much faster.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> Glean works well with lots of small files, but is inefficient when searching huge (&gt;10-25 MB) files; grep searches them as a whole. A secondary indexing mode for large files (based on delta-encoded page offsets) is planned but not yet implemented.<p>
Bugs and other issues are listed on the github page at <b>http://github.com/silentbicycle/glean.</b><p>
